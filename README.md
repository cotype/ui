Cotype manages structured content that can accessed via APIs.
The system itself is not concerned with the actual rendering of the data - this is left completely to the consumer which could be a server that generates HTML, a client-rendered web app or a native app that reads the data via HTTP.

This is the ui package for the cotype admin dashboard.
